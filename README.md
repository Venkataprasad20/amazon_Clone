ðŸ“˜ Project Description
Project Title: Amazon Clone (Mini Project)

Overview:
This mini project is a visually accurate static clone of the Amazon homepage, created using only HTML5 and CSS3. It showcases my understanding of fundamental front-end development concepts such as layout design, responsive structuring, and clean user interface styling.

The goal of this project was to replicate the look and feel of a real-world e-commerce platform to sharpen my skills in building structured and styled web pages â€” without any interactive functionality or backend integration.

ðŸš« Functionality Note
This is a static webpage only â€” there is no JavaScript or backend logic involved. All buttons, search bars, and links are non-functional and created for design and layout demonstration purposes only.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
HTML5 â€“ for structuring the webpage

CSS3 â€“ for styling and layout

VS Code â€“ for writing and editing code

Git â€“ for version control.
